Ideja1: Provjerimo jeli konzistenta jer je to brže i konzistentna heuristika je nužno optimistična. Ako nije, 
       umjesto da za svako stanje računamo najbržu putanju od tog stanja do ciljnog, uzmimo sva stanja koja smo pokupili putem
       jer je i taj put njihov najbrži. Također, možemo dodati da čim naiđemo na situaciju gdje heuristika nije optimistična, prekidamo ju.

Složenosti:
       prostorna = O(n * b^[1+C∗/ε]), vremenska = O(n * b^[1+C∗/ε])
